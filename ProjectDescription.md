# Project: Online Store Inventory Management System
In this project, we will create a simple database to store information about products in an online store. We will define tables for storing product information, customer information, and order information. We will also write SQL queries to extract useful information from the database.

## Step 1: Creating the database
The first step is to create a new database in SQL. You can use any SQL database management system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. Let's call our database "OnlineStore". You can use the following SQL command to create a new database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE OnlineStore;
```

## Step 2: Creating the tables
Next, we need to define the tables that will store the information in our database. We will create three tables: "Products", "Customers", and "Orders". Here are the SQL commands to create these tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Stock INT
);

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);
```

## Step 3: Adding data to the tables
Next, we need to add some data to the tables so that we can test our SQL queries. Here are some sample data that you can use:
```sql
INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Stock)
VALUES (1, 'Product A', 10.99, 100);

INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Stock)
VALUES (2, 'Product B', 5.99, 50);

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email)
VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'janesmith@example.com');

INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, OrderDate)
VALUES (1, 1, 1, 2, '2023-05-01');

INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, OrderDate)
VALUES (2, 2, 1, 1, '2023-05-03');

INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, OrderDate)
VALUES (3, 2, 2, 3, '2023-05-05');

```

## Step 4: Writing SQL queries
Now that we have created the database and added some data, we can write SQL queries to extract information from the database. Here are some example queries:

Retrieve all products from the Products table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Products;
```
Retrieve all customers from the Customers table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```
Retrieve all orders from the Orders table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders;
```
Retrieve the total number of orders:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders;
```
Retrieve the total revenue generated by all orders:
```sql
SELECT SUM(Quantity * Price) FROM Orders
JOIN Products ON Orders.ProductID = Products.ProductID;
```
